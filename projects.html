		<h4> Intelligent agent for the Dvonn game</h4>
		<img src="images/projects/dvonn.png" width="118" height="118" alt="Codecup 2011" align="right"/>
		<p>I participated in <a href="http://www.codecup.nl/" target="_blank"> Codecup </a> annual programming contest 2011, implementing an intelligent player for a board game named Dvonn.
		I used Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning and an effective heuristic evaluation function in my design. My agent was a finalist in the contest.

		<h4> ACM Collegiate Programming Competition</h4>
		<img src="images/projects/acm.jpg" width="118" height="118" alt="ACM 2010" align="right"/>
		<p> During the 4th and 5th semesters of B.S., I focused on ACM programming competition. I was a member of Shiraz University ACM group where we studied algorithms, 
		practiced programming and participated in 
		weekly contests. Our team was selected to take part in the Asia Regional Contest in Tehran site, 2010, where we ranked 10th/80 and were also honoured as the best all-women 
		team in the competition.

		<h4> Chemistry</h4>
		<img src="images/projects/chemistry.jpg" width="118" height="118" alt="Chemistry" align="right"/>
		<p> During the 2nd and 3rd years of high school, I spent a  lot of my time studying Chemistry. After two rounds of competitive exams, 
		I was among the selected students taking part in the Chemistry Olympiad summer school in Young Scholars Club(YSC), Tehran, Summer 2007. 
		I won a silver medal at the end of the summer school in the final round of the 25th National Student Chemistry Olympiad.
